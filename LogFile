	my exec wasn't working becuase I didnt end the array with NULL

	my appending may be wrong
	interrupt signal works, killing child processes, as well as removing semaphore and shared mem id.
	I think that shouldnt be assumed and mentioned in the documentation requirements.

	in the final stages, I need to add the if debug code, so program doesn't have to sleep to compare times.
	unfortunately I do not remember that from class, will be asking dr. Bhatia.
